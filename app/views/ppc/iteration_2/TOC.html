          By submitting, you are agreeing to pay 10 instalments of Â£10.59.

          If instalments are not kept up, you are not entitled to use the prepayment. <br><br>You could choose an alternative method of payment to avoid defaulting.
          
          If you use the prepayment after failing to pay an instalment, you may have to pay a penalty charge. <br><br>
          
          If you repeatedly fail to pay your prepayment instalments, you may not be able to pay by Direct Debit in the future.
