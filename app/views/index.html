      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">
      Having to pay for a lot of NHS prescriptions seperately may become expensive.
      It may be cheaper to buy a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) – 
      effectively a prescription "season ticket".</p>


      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">
      A PPC covers all NHS prescriptions, including NHS dental prescriptions, no matter how many items are needed.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">
      However, it does not cover the cost of other health-related items, 
      such as the provision of wigs and fabric supports, which are only provided through the hospital service.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">
      There are 3 PPC options to choose from:
      <ol>
        <li>The 3-month PPC which costs £31.25 and will save money if a person needs more than 3 prescribed items in 3 months.</li> 
        <li>The 12-month PPC which costs £111.60 and will save a person money if they need more than 11 prescribed items in a year.</li>
        <li>The hormone replacement therapy (HRT) PPC which costs £19.30 and will save a person money if they need more than 2 prescribed HRT items in a year.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">
        The HRT PPC is only for HRT medicines licensed to treat menopause symptoms, but can be used regardless of the reasons why certain medicines are prescribed for someone.

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Hypothesis A</h3>
          <p style="background: #DEE0E2; padding: 20px;"><strong>We believe</strong> that redesigining PPC online with the NHSUK Front end Kit
                 <strong>will be a useful feature for</strong>
             users <strong>as it will</strong> create familiarity and trust with users with the NHS branding. It is also up to date with the 
             accessiblity point of view as well as being more recognisable and trustworthy to end users. <strong>This will</strong> help users to confidently use the service.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Hypothesis B</h3>
          <p style="background: #DEE0E2; padding: 20px;"><strong>We believe</strong> that redesigining PPC online user flow based on pain points & user feedback
                 <strong>will be a useful feature for</strong>
             users <strong>as it will</strong> create a better user experience while purchasing a PPC. <strong>This will</strong> help users to quickly and easily obtain help with health costs.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we reviewed:</h3>
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
             <li>Created a back link </li>
             <li>Removed the cancel link </li>
             <li>Content in the Start page</li>
             <li>Following GDS guidance changed 'Next' label to 'Continue'</li>
             <li>Re-designed 'How long do you want your PPC to last?' screen : broke it into several screens 
               (to follow GDS guidance of 1 question per page)</li>
               <li>Re-designed : When do you want your PPC to start? This screen has been split into 3 different screens to cater 3 different users (New user, User with expiring certificate,
                 User with expired cert) - we believe by displaying information relevant to this type user might be useful to them to ease their user experience (This is following the implementation of the new API Exemtption Search)</li>
               <li>Following user research  a user need been identified (link) : added information about Prescription payment refund</li>
               <li>Following user feedback on how many screens it takes to key in address - this has been shortened & simplified</li>
             <li> (MOVED TO NEXT SPRINT / ITERATION)Moved DD details (on when payment will be taken) to Bank Details screen from the above screen to avoid 
               cognitive overload & to avoid long information in an conditional reveal</li>
               <li>(MOVED TO NEXT SPRINT / ITERATION)Information on renewal for users who chose to pay via DD</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we plan to test:</h3>
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
             <li>Whether or not users finding it easy to manoeuvre the new user journey </li>
             <li>How do users fill up the new address screen</li>
             <li>How do users find information about 'What option is best for me' in 'How long do you want your PPC to last?' screen </li>
             <li>Do users find it useful having information about their current PPC - is it expired? when is it expiring?</li>
             <li> 2 different screens for 'How would you like to receive your PPC'/ 'Would you like to receive your certificate by email?'</li>
             <li>FP57 - the refund receipts : Do users know this? is it a helpful information to them?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What we found:</h3>
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>2 participants welcomed the opening line about saving money</li>
             <li>Start page : 'How it works' section is it a right title?</li>
             <li>New address screen : no partcipant had any issue with the new journey - they all managed to go through it without any problem</li>
             <li> The 3 months option explanation was queried by 2 participants. Both felt it wasn’t clear how much you would save / what your break even point is</li>
              <li>One participant said that it is a pain to have to phone up to change the regular dates. They and another said that many people want to set their outgoing dates 
                to suit their salary dates, so why do we make people phone up to do it? </li>
                <li>The screen - 'Would you like to receive your certificate by email?'- was welcomed by all participants</li>
