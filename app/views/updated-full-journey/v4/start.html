      <p>
        Use this service to buy a PPC.
      </p>

      <p>A PPC allows you to save money on NHS prescriptions, including dental prescriptions, by prepaying for them no matter how many you need.</p>

      <p>You can pay a set price for prescriptions for 3 or 12 months, no matter how many you need.</p>

<p>A prescription costs £9.65 per item, but prepaying for an unlimited number of prescriptions is:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>£31.25 for 3 months</li>
        <li>£111.60 for 12 months (or 10 Direct Debit instalments of £11.16)</li>
      </ul>


      

     <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
     <p>Show your certificate details when you collect your prescription. You can collect prescriptions straight away, if your start date is today or earlier.</p>
      
      <p>We can send your certificate details by email, or you can print them at the end of the service.</p>

      <p>If you are applying on behalf of someone else, fill in the application using their details rather than your own.</p>

     
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
     <p>You'll need:</p>
     <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>a valid debit or credit card to buy a PPC</li>
     </ul>

    </a>
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Other ways to buy</h3>
      <p>The quickest way to buy a certificate is online. If you can't, there are <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/nhs-prescription-prepayment-certificate-ppc">other ways to buy one</a>.</p>
      <p>You cannot get a PPC by post using this online service. If you need it by post, you can buy one from some pharmacies.</p>
